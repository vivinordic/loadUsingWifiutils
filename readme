The following folder contains the scripts to run the LMAC TB on SIM/FPGA
The python script : 1.Loads the the firmware image 
					2.prepares and sends the commands to firware 
					3.Prepaers the test cases as per the inputs from Excel sheet

The lmac_tb code needs to be compiled only once. The command is the following: 
																				make -f Makefile.mak  | grep "error"
					
The command to compile crypto module is : 
										sudo gcc -v -shared -Wall -I/usr/include/python2.7 -lpython2.7 -o cryptoTb.so -fPIC *.c *.h 2>&1 | grep "error"

Edit the testPlan1.0.xls file - Initialization Params sheet to provide the required elf, sim/emu/fpga number

The python code main file starts from automation.py 

Python code compilation is : 
							python automation.py
							
							
Detailed steps to run: 
	1. Take copy from p4
	2. Compile LMAC firmware (as usual)
	3. Check if relative path is correct in excel sheet
	4. Point the sheet to run in excel sheet (its set to "All") 
	5. Cd to test/lmac/automation/lmacScripts
	6. Cd to lmac_tb 
	7. run - make -f Makefile.mak  | grep "error"
	8. the "cd .."  to lmac/automation/lmacScripts
	9. run "python automation.py"
